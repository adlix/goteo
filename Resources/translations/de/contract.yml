guide-contract-accounts: 'In this step, you have to provide the bank account in which you would like to receive the payment of the raised funds, as well as the account holder''s name. If you indicated a PayPal account, you must also provide us the name of the holder of that account (if your project is part of a Cloudfunding call, you don''t need to do so). Remember that, regarding tax, you will receive the raised funds as a donation from the Goteo Foundation for the development of the project. It is a payment with no V.A.T., and no invoice, which is why we count on the signed contract, to which we will attach the receipt of the transfer. <b>1. If you are legal bodies: </b>The fundraising is liable to Corporate Income Tax.  In the case of non-profit entities, you should consult your tax advisor in order to find out whether you are exempt or not, since it depends on each individual case. <b>2. In the case of individual persons: </b> The money raised is liable to Income Tax, and there can be two scenarios: a/ That the raised money is destined to an economic activity, and that you are registered in this section. If this is the case, you will be able to deduct the costs generated by the project. b/ If you are not involved in any economic activity, and not registered as such, the raised money will be a net capital gain. In this case, you will not be able to deduct the costs involved. When receiving the donation from Goteo Foundation, an entity managed by Goteo, you are NOT subject to Inheritance and Donation Tax, according to Article 3 of the Tax Reglament, which, among other things, declares as exempt "the subsidies, grants, premiums, gratifications and aid conceded by Public or Private Entities with charity, educational, cultural, sports or social action-related goals".'
